On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, create a well with the flour.\\n2. Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.\\n3. Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix the eggs into the flour, incorporating a little at a time.\\n4. Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands until it forms a smooth and elastic ball. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a little water, teaspoon by teaspoon, until it reaches the desired consistency.\\n5. Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax and makes the dough easier to work with.\\n6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions for easier handling.\\n7. Take one portion and flatten it with your hands or a rolling pin until it becomes a thin sheet. Make sure to dust the surface and the dough with flour to prevent sticking.\\n8. If you have a pasta machine, you can pass the dough through it, starting with the widest setting and gradually reducing the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta. If you don't have a pasta machine, you can continue rolling the dough with a rolling pin until it reaches the desired thickness.\\n9. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. For example, you can make fettuccine by cutting the dough into thin strips or make farfalle by cutting small rectangles and pinching them in the middle.\\n10. As you cut the pasta, lay it out on a floured surface or hang it on a pasta drying rack to prevent sticking.\\n11. Repeat the process with the remaining dough portions until all the pasta is made.\\n12. To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook it until al dente, which means it should still have a slight bite to it.\\n13. Drain the cooked pasta and serve it with your favorite sauce or toppings.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade Italian pasta!\",\n",
